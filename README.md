We are currently doing linear algebra as a course and so I do lot of boring-ass calculations involving matrices. In this repo, I have set out to automate all the boring calculations, so that I can spend less time on my assignments.

#### So far I have implemented:

    1. Determinants Of Matrices
    2. Adjoint(Adjucate?) Of Matrices
    3. Inverse Of Matrices (will throw exception for singular matrices)
    4. Normal and Reduced Echelon Forms of Matrix, and hence verification of consistency for a linear system of equations

#### I hope to also implement:

    1. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
    2. Diagonilization of Matrices

Also if I have time, I will make this a website so other people can use it.
